#Cuties Bot
### This repo is basically abandoned.
That said, the code has been moved to a new repo [picture-bot](https://github.com/FluffyPira/cuties-bot) and thus is no longer being maintained. The reason for this is I could not get rid of the 100 ish mb of picture files I uploaded initially with the bot since it's essentially the code of an already functioning bot.

Whoops.

Because of that silly mistake and the failure of all attempted fixes, I've decided to move the code to a new repo with a new name that describes it's function a little better and is less based around an already functioning twitter bot.

Apologies for any inconvinience and contributions lost in the switch. It was my mistake and I'm very sorry, I just did not necessarily expect this to become a Thingâ„¢ back when I initially pushed it and some months later now realize pushing all the picutres with it was a collosal failure on my part. :(

If, for some reason, you still want to use this repo, clone it and follow the instructions found on [picture-bot](https://github.com/FluffyPira/cuties-bot).
